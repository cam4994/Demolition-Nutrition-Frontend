## Inspiration
My passion for nutrition and fitness is what led me to build Demolition Nutrition. I've always enjoyed keeping track of my daily calorie and macronutrient totals but hated having to pay to do so. I also found myself constantly struggling to find food from restaurants that met my current macronutrient requirements based on the diet I was following. The search tool allows you to find food and make sure all the results fall within the caloric or macronutrient target you are looking for.
